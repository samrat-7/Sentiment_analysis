Imagine having the power to observe your customer’s thoughts, like what they really think of a particular product/service.
For instance, there is a new product/Web Series  launched by a company and posted them on their social media accounts like Instagram or Facebook for marketing purposes.

Is it possible for an individual to check all the thousands or lakhs of comments, obviously some will be good, and some will be bad?

As it is crucial to understand the customer behavior regarding the product/service offered:

The answer is NO, an individual can’t do that, but what if he/she could do it?
