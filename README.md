Imagine having the power to observe your customer’s thoughts, like what they really think of a particular product/service.
For instance, there is a new product/Web Series  launched by a company and posted them on their social media accounts like Instagram or Facebook for marketing purposes.

Is it possible for an individual to check all the thousands or lakhs of comments, obviously some will be good, and some will be bad?

As it is crucial to understand the customer behavior regarding the product/service offered:

The customer’s perception is your reality.

But is it really possible to understand every comment?

The answer is NO, an individual can’t do that, but what if he/she could do it?
Wouldn’t it be fascinating to do that?
It can be done using Natural Language Processing Technique (NLP).

As we all know, that computer understands Binary language, i.e., the language of 0 and 1. But with the help of NLP, we can help it to understand the HUMAN LANGUAGE as it creates dummy variables for all the alphabets, and it has a word cloud net commonly known as Dictionary from where it learns about the different meaning of the words that we use.

In simpler language, NLP is a process in which we make the computer understand our Human Language, then further we can perform any text analysis.
